# Super Mario Bros X Image Tool

This is a simple tool made to handle various tasks involving images. The principal task is to join images toghether in a single image, for easy recoloring, and splitting them afterwards. It can also resize images (to do) and import/export spritesheets (to do).

This tool was originally made by FrozenQuills, but I asked and was granted the permission to edit and extend it. Only contributor is me, I'm not asking for any more.
